The action replay API will act as middleware between
the user program and the controller inputs. The user
will be able to switch between two modes:
- Controller Passthrough
    This mode will pass all input from the controller
    directly into the visible API components.
- Replay Mode
    This mode will take an input file containing 
    controller inputs and replay them back to the API
    frontend.

All methods and fields for the built-in controller 
API will be available on the Action-Replay frontend.
This will make the process of migrating to A-R much
easier.

The inputs file is a CSV with the following fields:
    A1, A2, A3, A4, A, B, X, Y, U, D, L, R, L1, L2, R1, R2
Each row of inputs is recorded 30ms apart
